# QualIQon
The QualIQon tool aims to enable visual quality control of typical analysis processes in mass spectrometry-based proteomics by displaying various properties from processing steps such as peptide spectrum matching, quantification and protein identification. This is ensured by a FAIR workflow that is embedded in the ARC framework. Currently the tool generates up to seven plots that examine various aspects of commonly used analysis steps. These include peptide spectrum matching, peptide spectrum matching-based statistics and quantification, and protein identification. The results obtained indicate that QualIQon is capable of enabling automated visual quality control for proteomic mass spectrometry data by utilising the FAIR-compliant workflow embedded in the ARC framework and running in a Docker container environment.
